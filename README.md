# RANSACImageMosaic

This part of the project was taking multiple images shot of the same scene (with the camera simply being rotated and taking pictures while being rotated), warping one image such that this warped image now has the same perspective of the other image (meaning we warp it into the first image's projection), and then stitching the two images together. To change the perspective of the other image, we use homography transformations that were used above. I simply marked features on both images, and these served as correspondent points The two images were stitched together based on feature selection of both images, and lining up the images based so the features on both images line up on top of each other. When stacking images on top of each other at first, I naively just added half the pixel value of the first image to half the pixel value of the second image for regions where there were overlap. Finally, since homographies change the actual shape of the image (meaning it's not the same rectagular size as before), it was necessary to first compute the resulting coordinates for the four corners of the input image we wanted to morph, and then enlarge the picture so that the resulting picture after morphing could fit entirely in this new picture. Additionally, the image that wasn't warped needed to be translated to the final location in the mosaic due to the fact that with the offset, the images are now shifted.
